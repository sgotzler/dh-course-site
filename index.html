      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      
      <p>How do digital technologies shape the way we produce, analyze, and share knowledge? This course introduces students to the history, methods, and critical questions of the digital humanities—an interdisciplinary field that brings computational tools into conversation with humanistic inquiry. Rather than treating technology as a neutral instrument, we will examine how digital methods carry assumptions about what counts as evidence, how arguments are made, and whose knowledge gets preserved.</p>

      <p>The course is organized around three interrelated questions:</p>

      <div class="questions-grid">
        <div class="question-card">
          <h3>What is Data?</h3>
          <p>Exploring how texts become computable objects, how humanities scholars have used computational analysis to study literature and culture, and how AI technologies are transforming research practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-card">
          <h3>How Does Computation Shape Culture?</h3>
          <p>Turning to digital games as a case study in how rule-based systems produce meaning, shape user experience, and reflect broader cultural logics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-card">
          <h3>Why Do We Build Architectures of Knowledge?</h3>
          <p>Examining the material infrastructures that underlie digital scholarship, from data centers to sustainable web design.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Students will gain hands-on experience with text analysis tools and AI-assisted methods while developing critical frameworks for evaluating their outputs and limitations. Through close play and multimedia composition, students will analyze games as artifacts of digital culture and develop video essays that make visual arguments about computational form. Drawing on minimal computing principles, students will consider how platform choices, preservation practices, and design decisions embed social values.</p>

      <p>Each segment of the course scaffolds technical skills through structured tutorials and low-stakes exercises before moving to larger compositional tasks; peer workshops provide opportunities for collaborative feedback and skill-sharing. Students will build toward a final project of their choosing: a data visualization and narrative, a video essay, a digital exhibit, or a minimal web project.</p>

      <p><strong>No prior technical background is required</strong>—only curiosity about how computation is reshaping humanistic inquiry, and willingness to experiment.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Symposium -->
    <section>
      <h2>DH Project Symposium</h2>
      <p>At the conclusion of the course, we will hold a DH Project Symposium with invited members of the public and the digital humanities community to showcase student work and translate research to public audiences. Students will present their final projects to the class and invited guests, with format depending on project type (live demonstration, screening, guided tour, etc.). This symposium prepares students to communicate their scholarship across different settings and to audiences with varying levels of expertise.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Learning Objectives -->
    <section>
      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
      <ul class="objectives-list">
        <li>Articulate the history and key debates of digital humanities as a field</li>
        <li>Apply computational methods (text analysis, data visualization, multimedia composition) to humanistic research questions</li>
        <li>Critically evaluate AI technologies and their implications for scholarship and knowledge production</li>
        <li>Analyze digital games and other computational media as cultural artifacts</li>
        <li>Assess digital projects for their technical choices, sustainability, and embedded values</li>
        <li>Design and produce an original digital humanities project</li>
        <li>Document and reflect on their use of digital tools and methods</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Required Materials -->
    <section>
      <h2>Required Materials</h2>
      <p>All readings, digital toolkits, and example projects will be provided as PDFs or links via Canvas. You should have a laptop available for each class session.</p>
