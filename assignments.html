    <p>Each segment of the course scaffolds technical skills through structured tutorials and low-stakes exercises before moving to larger compositional tasks. Peer workshops provide opportunities for collaborative feedback and skill-sharing. Students will build toward a final project of their choosing. No prior technical background is required—only curiosity about how computation is reshaping humanistic inquiry, and willingness to experiment.</p>

    <!-- Attendance & Participation -->
    <div class="assignment">
      <h3>Attendance & Participation <span class="weight">10%</span></h3>
      
      <p>Everything we do in this course will be rooted in two core activities: critical reading and hands-on experimentation.</p>
      
      <p>A significant portion of our class time will be devoted to tutorials, workshops, and collaborative exercises where you will gain practical experience with digital humanities tools and methods. Some sessions will involve working individually at your laptop; others will involve small-group collaboration, peer feedback, or whole-class discussion of project examples. The course will also run as a discussion-based seminar, where we explore the readings, debate methodological questions, and critically examine the digital projects we encounter together.</p>
      
      <p>Your participation grade reflects both your presence and your engagement. This means coming to class prepared, contributing to discussions, offering constructive feedback during peer workshops, and approaching hands-on activities with curiosity and effort—even when the technical work feels unfamiliar or frustrating. Digital humanities is fundamentally collaborative, and the quality of our shared inquiry depends on everyone's active involvement.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- DH Diaries -->
    <div class="assignment">
      <h3>DH Diaries (ongoing) <span class="weight">20%</span></h3>
      
      <p>Throughout the semester, you will maintain a DH Diary—a space for deliberate, guided reflection on course materials, practical experimentation with digital tools, and process documentation related to your evolving research interests. These diary entries are designed to help you develop a vocabulary for describing what digital methods do and don't do well, and to cultivate the habits of critical reflection essential to digital humanities practice.</p>
      
      <p>Each week, you will submit diary entries in response to specific prompts. These prompts will range in style and substance: some will ask you to apply a key concept from the week's readings to a hands-on exercise; others will pose methodological challenges or invite you to reflect on your research process and emerging interests. A recurring thread throughout the diaries will be your critical engagement with AI tools. As we study artificial intelligence as both an object of inquiry and a practical instrument, your diaries will document how you use (or choose not to use) AI in your work, what it enables and forecloses, and how your understanding of these technologies develops over the semester.</p>
      
      <p>While each entry will be assessed individually, many will contribute directly to the development of your final project. The diaries are thus both a record of learning and a generative space for your own scholarly and creative work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Due:</strong> Weekly (approximately 10 entries across the semester)</p>

    <!-- Scaffolding Assignments -->
    <div class="assignment">
      <h3>Scaffolding Assignments <span class="weight">40%</span></h3>
      
      <p>Each segment of the course includes scaffolding assignments as skill-building exercises to prepare you for larger projects. Your eventual final project should build organically upon the preliminary research design and exploratory analysis you will accomplish for one (or more) of the following assignments:</p>
      
      <ul class="project-options">
        <li><strong>Text as Data:</strong> corpus exploration and textual data visualization</li>
        <li><strong>Computational Culture:</strong> close play observation worksheets; storyboard and script abstract</li>
        <li><strong>Architectures of Knowledge:</strong> platform analysis</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Due:</strong> Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Final Project -->
    <div class="assignment">
      <h3>Final Project <span class="weight">30%</span></h3>
      
      <p>A substantial digital project of your choosing, grounded in self-directed research, and developed through a three-stage process of (1) proposal → (2) prototype → (3) final deliverable with reflective statement about how the use of digital methods shaped your research process.</p>
      
      <h4>Project Options</h4>
      
      <ul class="project-options">
        <li><strong>Data Story / Visualization Project</strong> — A computational text analysis paired with visualizations and interpretive narrative</li>
        <li><strong>Videographic Essay</strong> — A multimedia argument analyzing a computational media object such as a game, app, or platform (4–6 minutes)</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Exhibit</strong> — A curated collection of digital artifacts with contextual framing and critical apparatus</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal Web Project</strong> — A small-scale digital edition, toolkit, or resource built using minimal computing principles</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>All final projects require a reflective statement that documents your process, explains your methodological choices, and critically assesses the strengths and limitations of your work.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- DH Project Symposium -->
    <div class="assignment">
      <h3>DH Project Symposium</h3>
      
      <p>At the conclusion of the course, we will hold a class symposium with invited members of the public and the DH community to showcase our work and translate our work to a public audience. Students will present their final projects to the class and invited guests. Format will depend on project type (live demonstration, screening, guided tour, etc.).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Due:</strong> Final Exam Period (TBD)</p>
